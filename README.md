Redefining Cancer Treatment Using Machine Learning: A Personalized Medicine Approach is a project that uses NLP and ML to predict the class of the gene mutation helping the doctors take a personalized approach to the treatment. 
Abstract
Personalized medicine, which tailors medical treatments to individual patients based on their unique characteristics, has shown great potential in oncology. In particular, the field of cancer treatment has been revolutionized by the introduction of personalized medicine, as it considers elements such as a patient's genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environment to develop a tailored approach. Recent advances in genomic sequencing and machine learning algorithms have enabled the analysis of large volumes of genomic and clinical data to identify personalized treatment options for cancer patients. Huge volumes of genetic data are being created in the field of medicine by research and development (R&D), doctors' offices, clinics, patients, and carers, which requires careful organizing. As a result, diagnostic sequencing is being used more often. Machine learning algorithms can analyze complex data sets, including genomic and clinical data, to identify personalized treatment options for individual patients. This approach can provide more effective and tailored therapies for cancer patients, improving treatment outcomes and quality of life while reducing healthcare costs. Machine learning has demonstrated great potential in the treatment of several malignancies, including melanoma, breast, and lung cancer. Targeted medicines that are more successful than conventional chemotherapy can be used in personalized medicine to pinpoint particular mutations or biomarkers that are fueling a patient's cancer growth. Machine learning-based approaches can help to identify these mutations and biomarkers, enabling clinicians to select the most effective treatment options. In areas where clinicians previously relied on visually recognizing patterns that signal the existence or kind of the ailment, diagnosis by machine learning works when the condition can be reduced to a classification problem on physiological data. Machine learning in personalized medicine can also help to accelerate the development of new cancer therapies by identifying novel drug targets. With continued advances in genomics and technology, personalized medicine is expected to become an increasingly important tool in the fight against cancer. Machine learning-based approaches can help to optimize personalized cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient healthcare practices.
